# Team Photos

This folder contains five photos of the participating team members:

- `Official (Name).jfif` – Each of our formal photo used for competition registration and documentation
- `Funny.jpg` – A creative or lighthearted photo of the whole team, showcasing team spirit and collaboration

These photos reflect the human side of our engineering journey (both serious and fun!)
