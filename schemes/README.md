# Schematic Diagrams

This folder contains schematic diagrams of the robot's electromechanical system. These diagrams illustrate the connection and arrangement of:

- Sensors (IR, proximity, IMU)
- Actuators (DC motor, servo motor)
- Microcontrollers (Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- Power supply and motor driver wiring

Diagrams are provided in either `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.pdf` formats for easy viewing and printing.

Use these files to understand the complete wiring layout and signal flow between all components used in the self-driving vehicle.
